# Zuif

A web framework for [Fermyon Spin](https://www.fermyon.com/spin) that enables full-stack web development using WebAssembly on both client and server sides, similar to [Leptos](https://leptos.dev/) for Rust.

## Overview

Zuif is designed to work seamlessly with the Spin framework, providing a complete solution for building modern web applications with:

- **Full WASM Stack**: WebAssembly on both client and server
- **Fractal TEA Architecture**: Based on The Elm Architecture with fractal component composition
- **Flexible Rendering**: Support for both Single Page Applications (SPA) and Server-Side Rendering (SSR)
- **Zig Language**: Leveraging Zig's simplicity, performance, and WebAssembly support
